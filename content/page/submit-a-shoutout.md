If you or your band would like to be a part of Six Degrees of Ohio, record yourself saying something like:

> This is <name> from <city>, and you're listening to Six Degrees of Ohio on Wadsworth Community Radio

Remember! This is just a suggestion, and not a script. Be creative! Go nuts! Just remember that we must comply with FCC rules, so no cussing.

Here are a few examples:

**Cara from Seaside Holiday**

**Adam from Phestur**

**Chad from the War Toys**
{{< audio_player src="https://six-degrees-podcast.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/shoutouts/SDOH-shoutout-Chad-Jenson.mp3" >}}
