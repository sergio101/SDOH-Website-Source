I host a radio show on Wadsworth Community Radio each Saturday night at 8PM Ohio time. I showcase local music from or related to the Ohio area. We play an hour of music that you might not find anywhere else.

II am constantly on the lookout for new material:
- Recordings of bands from or related to Ohio. Send finished/mastered recordings, no demos.
- Recordings will be aired on FM radio, so they will be subject to FCC rules. This can be read “No cussing, or singing about things that would be otherwise banned.”
- You need not be actively playing out or recording.
- Any genre is welcome, but I will be curating the shows so that they make sense and don’t confuse the listener.

# Submission Guidelines
- You are welcome to submit two high-quality (128k or better,) mp3 (FLAC preferred) to sergio@sixdegreesofohio.com. If you would rather submit physical media, contact me at the same address for the mailing address.
- When submitting a full album, please indicate which track(s) you would like to have considered for review.
- Please submit full contact info: email address, web address, phone number, and any social media links.
- If you are actively playing out, please include a link to your tour dates.
