If you or your band would like to be a part of Six Degrees of Ohio, record yourself saying something like:

> This is <name> from <city>, and you're listening to Six Degrees of Ohio on Wadsworth Community Radio

Remember! This is just a suggestion, and not a script. Be creative! Go nuts! Just remember that we must comply with FCC rules, so no cussing.

Once you have your recording done, send it to me via email at:

sergio@sixdegreesofohio.com
 
If you're here to submit music for airplay, make your way to:
