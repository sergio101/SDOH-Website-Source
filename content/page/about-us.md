There is no us, there is just me, your faithful DJ, your old pal, Sergio.

I grew up listening to radio stations from all over the world on a homemade shortwave radio. I loved listening to people spinning playlists from the ether, and always felt like I was discovering things that had been unknown.

I dreamed about being that guy, sharing my record collection over the airwaves.

In an era where everything is available online, I am most content to know that I am sharing record finds with friends, both old and new. And that sharing happens on the air.

You will find music from Ohio, and in most cases, it will be from friends of mine whom I have shared the stage with over the years.

Enjoy.
