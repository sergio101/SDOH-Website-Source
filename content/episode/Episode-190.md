# Audio and show notes

We played [Gina Brooklyn](https://www.facebook.com/ginabrooklynnmusic/). If my memory serves me correctly, her parents played in the band [Krank](http://www.krank1.com), whom we covered for The Village Buzz back in the 90s.

The Village Buzz was a paper-based music magazine that we published in the 90s, before the days of the internet.

I did an Interview with [Chris Donley](https://chrisdonleymusic.bandcamp.com) recently. You can see the whole thing [Here](post/my-interview-with-chris-donley/).

"Daily Life" by [Tim Easton](https://www.timeaston.com) and the Feelan Barons played the intro music to "The Midwest Report," a segment I hosted on [KSCB](https://www.kcsb.org) in Santa Barbara, California. When I get a few minutes, I'll start posting episodes of that show.

I did a music video for The [Tony Lang Band](https://www.facebook.com/TonyLangBand/). You can see it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALh9WkV3G2Y&list=RDALh9WkV3G2Y&start_radio=1).

The [Mike Farley Band](https://www.facebook.com/mikefarleyband/) will perform a 20th Anniversary show for Halfaworldaway on September 6, 2025. More details will follow.
