## Episode Notes
-  I used to record "The Sounds of Jamaica" on KPFK Los Angeles. There was a song on that show that I totally loved. I have been looking for the song forever. I have not idea what it's called. The only thing I remember is the lyrics were "You've got charm." Does anyone else out there remember this?
- If you like The Blue Herons, check out Francine Odessys, and Valuptous Panic.
- If Jim from Proverus is out there, get ahold of me!
- Check H Edward Currant for an interestsing bio. Should your bio be this interesting?
- Does anyone from the Stepford Five have any of the original 10Watt cassette records.
- Check out the Stepford Five's book [Are You Making A Sound?: The History of The Stepford Five](https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Making-Sound-Stepford-ebook/dp/B07B6QJHTW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2OOGEJPPARJ89&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tm8H0jh0lsLsX5852d5FBTlptuMZR3rdvwNiAmoCHEBpAAixXb15KA_PzEdmIZK_HeYE_F8HdvjT7lq_248QAIml8hYaAKRlUh7cWvJCMC8al9Iczdk-936jQtU1xkUHR7Ml8bWObYLsvUo8-XXc6YtGWlJETybGpLmv9pS7Tz3JoJWUg2SQ1SWqQxf-mbULk3Q_FLQ_CzYCVXFfoklmpjb1_vNnj-1qGGNWXkC-iFE.2zEytYxhropz0axn0ETZyteSRxli2-T_eYse5rnqIdI&dib_tag=se&keywords=stepford+five&qid=1747173100&sprefix=stepford+five%2Caps%2C264&sr=8-3).
