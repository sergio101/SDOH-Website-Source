## Episode Notes
-  I used to record "The Sounds of Jamaica" on KPFK Los Angeles. There was a song on that show that I totally loved. I have been looking for the song forever. I have not idea what it's called. The only thing I remember is the lyrics were "You've got charm." Does anyone else out there remember this?
- If you like The [Blue Herons](https://theblueherons.com), check out Francine Odessys, and [Voluptuous Panic](https://voluptuouspanic.com).
- If Jim from [Proverus](https://www.discogs.com/label/232258-Proverus-Records?srsltid=AfmBOop4ttRQRvYb-9v7yrYeFsUTX5XW87XNnMLxb3ctR6iTIM5KTd7J) is out there, get ahold of me!
- Check H Edward Currant for an interestsing bio. Should your bio be this interesting?
- Does anyone from the Stepford Five have any of the original 10Watt cassette records.
