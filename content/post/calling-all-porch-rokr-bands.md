## PorchRockr 2025
In case you are unfamiliar with the annual PorchRokr event, the area around Highland Square in Akron, OH transforms into a giant concert venue with more than 100 bands playing on the front porches of houses in the area.

If you haven't attended before, make sure you check the website for where to park, what to bring, and what to leave home. You will also want to take a look at the schedule ahead of time to plan your day and minimize your wandering.

For all details, [check the website](https://www.highlandsquareakron.org).

## Calling bands who are playing!

If your band is playing PorchRokr, I want to start playing your tracks and giving the audience a taste of what to expect. So, as always, submit those tracks!
