I had the pleasure of being interviewed by [Chris Donley](https://chrisdonleymusic.bandcamp.com) from the bands [Sindust](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5M1QausJuI3uEIOeGiUvXZ), [Critic City](https://www.criticcity.com), [LoveLag](https://www.lovelag.com/), and a bazillion other projects. This is a pretty deep dive, and it goes on for more than an hour. 

If you're interested in this kinda thing, go nuts! But I'll be breaking it down further with links to spots that might be interesting for everyone. For now, I am posting the entire thing.
