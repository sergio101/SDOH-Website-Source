For those unfamiliar with [Bandcamp Friday](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays), the BandCamp platform features a few Fridays each year where all revenues from sales of merch go directly to the artists. I suddenly realized that we most likely have lots of artists  in our group that have music on BandCamp.

in anticipation for the next BandCamp Friday, I'll be posting a page with links to all of our artists with a BandCamp presence. The next BandCamp Fridays this year will be on:

- August 1st
- September 5th
- October 3rd
- December 5th

I'll be reminding everyone as each event comes up, and hopefully, all artists will benefit!

## Submit those links!
So! If you are a featured artist, and you have a BandCamp presence or two, let me know (sergio@sixdegreesofohio.com), and I'll get the page posted ASAP! 

## You are not featured on the show yet?
If you are not yet played on the show, we can fix that! Check the [Submissions Page](/page/how-to-submit/), and we'll get you all taken care of.
