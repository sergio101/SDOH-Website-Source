In June, I'd like to create a theme-based show featuring live tracks from our featured artists. The idea is, and entire show of live music captured in your favorite clubs.

If you are not yet a featured artist (meaning you've been played on the show before), now is the perfect time to submit tracks and get into the rotation.
